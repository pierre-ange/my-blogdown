Ok, this is my first post, on my first website (woop!).

Why have I done such a thing? I guess there are a few reasons. To start with, I tend to follow passively the **#rstats** community on Twitter and have come across a variety of interesting and inspiring pieces, many of them published as blog posts. Second, I like the process of writing: you know, putting thoughts on paper, coming back to it, trimming it down, fleshing it out, and then sharing it once you're happy with it. David Robinson's [advice to data scientists](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) was also a motivation. Plus, I think it is fair to say that the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package has really made it easier for anyone to start a website, so why shouldn't I give it a go? 

So, here we are.

I don't know yet how regularly posts will be published, or even whether this blog will follow a consistent theme. Expect posts about finance, London, R, python, and whatever floats my boat at any given (free) time!

Pierre-Ange.
