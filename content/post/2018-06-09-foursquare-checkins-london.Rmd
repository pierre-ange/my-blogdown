## Plan

Foursquare, split into two separate apps (Foursquare and Swarm) around 2014, is very likely the mobile app I use most. It is a geolocalized venue recommendation app helping us find the best venues around, and Swarm is the associated check-in app. They complement one other nicely, as your Swarm check-ins influence the Foursquare venue recommendations you get based on the sort of places you tend to visit more often and reviews you've given, among other factors.

So yes, I tend to use these two apps quite often ... in fact I do check-in to most places I go. First because it does improve the Foursquare venue tips I get when visiting new areas and new cities, second because it keeps track of all the places I have been to along the years, and I really enjoy taking a look back at where I had dinner a year ago, or how many times I have been to this pizza place ... my geek side, I guess.

And [apparently](https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/say-hello-to-the-new-swarm-5-0-1f18bdda28da) I am not alone: the Swarm development team realized it, called this behaviour **lifelogging** and re-designed their app around it. For example, here below is a snapshot of the Profile section in Swarm. A map presents all the different places I've checked into, which can be zoomed in for more details.

Places are presented as clusters to avoid data overplotting. To get to see all venues as points, you would have to zoom in aggressively until only a handful of streets remain visible on screen.

For the purpose of this post, I will use the same dataset (restricted to London) to create another kind of maps. I especially want to visualize how the areas I spend most of my time have evolved since 2013 when I started checking in.
For this, I will:

* Connect to the Foursquare API to retrieve all my visited places and associated coordinates.
* Connect to Google Maps API to obtain a base map layer, and draw it thanks to `ggmap`.
* Connect to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API to obtain a more personal map layer. I'll use a map theme I designed using Mapbox Studio (I recommend everyone to give it a try, it is quite impressive what is possible to do).
* Use `ggplot2` to overlay the checkins points onto the map, and `facet_wrap` to split it by year.

## Foursquare API
To connect to the Foursquare API, you need to set up a developer account, create a new app, obtain a client ID and a Secret Key and authenticate your calls. This could be done in 5-10 mins by following the instructions given in the [Getting Started](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/getting-started) webpage. I have already done this so will skip this part: I have an ID, a Key, and a token to access my personal check-ins.

```{r, include=FALSE}
access_token <- read.table('~/Dev/Secret/fsq_token.txt',stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[1,1]
```

I have written a quick function to hit the API and get a data frame of checkins in return. This API call is detailed on the [Foursquare Development Portal](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/users/checkins). Each call can only return 250 results. I have approximately 2000 checkins to retrieve so a loop is necessary.

```{r get_checkins}
library(tidyverse)

get_checkins <- function(access_token){
  version <- format(Sys.Date(), '%Y%m%d')
  limit <- 250
  offset <- 0 # Will be incremented at every iteration, by `limit`
  
  while(TRUE){
    url <- glue::glue("https://api.foursquare.com/v2/users/self/checkins?oauth_token={access_token}&v={version}&limit={limit}&offset={offset}")
    resp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url, simplifyVector = T, flatten = T)
    items <- tibble::as_data_frame(resp$response$checkins$items)
    
    if(nrow(items) == 0) # No more check-ins to retrieve, exit loop
      break
    
    if(offset == 0){
      checkins <- items
    } else {
      checkins <- dplyr::bind_rows(checkins, items)
    }
    offset <- offset + limit
  }
  checkins
}
```

Let's call this function, and display the number of columns and rows of the returned data frame. It should be a rather wide one, so I won't display it here until tidied up.
```{r results='asis'}
checkins_raw <- get_checkins(access_token)
dim(checkins_raw)
```

Let's tidy up the dataset to select only the features we are interested in: check-in date, venue name, venue category, and coordinates. I am only interested in London check-ins so I will filter places based on their coordinates.
```{r results='asis'}
checkins <- checkins_raw %>%
  unnest(venue.categories) %>% #Unnesting makes venues with no categories dropped (https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/358)
  right_join(checkins_raw) %>% #Reinsert those venues, with category attributes set to NA
  select(date = createdAt,
         venue = venue.name, 
         cat = name,
         lat = venue.location.lat, 
         lng = venue.location.lng) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(date), as.POSIXct, origin = '1970-01-01') %>% #Seconds since epoch to date
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>%
  mutate(venue_trunc = stringr::str_trunc(venue, 20, ellipsis = '')) %>%
  filter(between(lng, -0.510375, 0.334016) & between(lat, 51.28676, 51.691874)) %>% # Only London
  arrange(date)

head(checkins) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html', align = 'l') %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 'striped', full_width = FALSE, position = 'left')
```

If we count the number of check-ins per year, we can see that apart from 2013 where I had only just started to check in, it has been pretty consistent over the years.
```{r}
dplyr::count(checkins, year) %>%
  tidyr::spread(year, n) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html') %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 'striped', full_width = FALSE, position = 'left')
```

Let's do a quick spatial plot to get started.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = checkins, aes(lng, lat), size=0.2) 
```

Would be better with a base map layer... next section!

## Google Maps API
We'll use the `ggmap` package to hit Google Maps API and retrieve static base layers of London.
For this, we need to register for a Google developer account in order to receive a personal key.
Some information on how to get such a key is provided on the [`ggmap` Github page](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) or directly on the [relevant Google page](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?hl=en).

```{r, include=FALSE}
google_key <- read.table('~/Dev/Secret/google_key.txt',stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[1,1]
```

```{r}
library(ggmap)
ggmap::register_google(key = google_key)

london <- c(lon = -0.118092, lat = 51.509865)
google_map <- ggmap::get_googlemap(london, 
                            zoom = 12, 
                            messaging = FALSE,
                            maptype = "roadmap")
```

```{r}
ggmap::ggmap(google_map, extent = 'device', maprange = TRUE) + 
  geom_point(data = checkins, aes(lng, lat), colour = '#ff4700', size=0.2) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = NULL)
```

## Mapbox API
Instead of the classic Google Maps theme, I want to use my own colours. For that, there is nothing easier than using another service provider: [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I have been very impressed by how easy Mapbox makes it to create personalized maps: you can do pretty much everything with it! To use their service, you would need to create an account, and register a token. All of it can be done rather quickly.

```{r, include=FALSE}
mapbox_token <- read.table('~/Dev/Secret/mapbox_token.txt',stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[1,1]
```

`ggmap` does not support yet Mapbox so I had to create another function, called `get_mapbox_map`, and heavily inspired from `ggmap::get_googlemap`. This function is loaded from a separate file.

```{r}
source('~/Dev/R/fsq-checkins/mapbox_lib.R')
mapbox_map <- get_mapbox_map(london, 
                             token = mapbox_token,
                             size = c(1200,1000),
                             username = 'pierreange',
                             style_id = 'cji7htgkw2cgh2sqpnn6tbzda',
                             attribution = TRUE,
                             logo = TRUE,
                             zoom = 11.9)
```

Let's have a quick look at this base map alone. Isn't it better than the base Google Maps theme? :)
```{r}
ggmap::ggmap(mapbox_map, extent = 'device')
```

## Check-ins overlay
```{r, include=FALSE}
source('~/Dev/R/fsq-checkins/density_lib.R')
```

Let's now overlay the checkins coordinates on the Mapbox map. I decided to define the point colours based on the spatial density:
```{r}
checkins$density <- get_density(checkins$lng, checkins$lat, 20)
seq_palette <- c('#108188', '#339198', '#4CA2A8', '#62B4B9', '#79C5CA', '#8ED7DA', '#A3E9EC')

plot_points <- ggmap::ggmap(mapbox_map, extent = 'device') +
  geom_point(data = checkins, aes(lng, lat, alpha = density, colour = density), size=0.3) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = NULL) +
  scale_alpha(range = c(.2,.7), guide = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(seq_palette), guide = FALSE)
plot_points
```


I now want to see the evolution along the years. Let's include a `facet_wrap` command:
```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
plot_points_year <- plot_points +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
        strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0.5, colour = 'gray35', family = 'Palatino', size = 11, face = 'bold'),
        panel.spacing = unit(.1, 'cm'))
plot_points_year
```

We can see the different zones where I spend most of my time, and if concentrated enough we can distinguish the differences between the years. We could see it better by using density maps intead of points.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
seq_palette_ext <- colorRampPalette(seq_palette) # Extend the range of colours

plot_pg <- ggmap::ggmap(mapbox_map, extent = 'device') +
  stat_density2d(data = checkins,
                 aes(x = lng, y = lat, fill = ..level.., alpha = ..level..),
                 n = 200, 
                 h = c(MASS::bandwidth.nrd(checkins$lng), 
                       MASS::bandwidth.nrd(checkins$lat)), 
                 geom = 'polygon') +
  scale_alpha(range = c(0,.5), trans = 'log', guide = FALSE)+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = seq_palette_ext(50), guide = FALSE)+
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
        strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0.5, colour = 'gray35', family = 'Palatino', size = 11, face = 'bold'),
        panel.spacing = unit(.1, 'cm')) +
  labs(title = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~year)
plot_pg
```

Now the different areas are much more clearly displayed! 

I love it, because it tells a story, and a rather personal one. This is my story of London, and all those points bring me some memories. 

Looking at the maps, in all these years there is a common cluster of check-ins in Marylebone/Baker Street. This makes total sense, as this is where my office was until recently! Then a second cluster usually refers to my home: Angel in 2013/2014, Earls Court in 2015/2016, Hoxton in 2017/2018. In 2018 I changed job and my office is now near St Pauls: we can see the new cluster in the area.

## Conclusion
With this project, I learned how to connect to Foursquare, Google Maps and Mapbox API, and to create maps with a few lines of R, personalized with my own data and my own theme.
