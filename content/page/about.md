My name is Pierre-Ange Oliva, welcome to my blog! 

I am a 27 year old chap from Lyon (France), currently based in London. In life, I enjoy the outdoors, travelling, music, and cycling. At home, I cook to relax.

My educational background is in engineering and aeronautics, but decided to work in finance instead. I am currently working at BNP Paribas as a market risk analyst.
Work usually involves quite a bit of data crunching, statistics, mathematics - this is where I've started programming in R, and have not stopped ever since.

Why have I started a blog?
=========

Iâ€™ve learned quite a lot from the public work of others, tend to follow passively the **#rstats** community on Twitter and have come across a variety of interesting pieces, many of them published as blog posts recently. David Robinson's [advice to data scientists](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) was also a motivation. Plus, I think it is fair to say that the [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package has really made it easier for anyone to start a website, so why wouldn't I give it a go? 

This blog is built with `blogdown` and `Hugo`, with the `Minimo` theme. I deploy my blog using Netlify.
